## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** PowerCreators – AI-Powered Content Creation Platform  
**Project Type:** Web application (single-page) using Vite + React (TypeScript)  
**Purpose:**  
Enable content creators and teams to interact with intelligent AI agents that manage tasks like content generation, offer creation, personas, marketing campaigns, templating, and real-time chat playground for testing and iterating on agent templates. The platform should provide tools for managing AI agents, templates, categories, tags, and chat sessions in a highly performant and user-friendly interface.   

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Performance & Scalability:**  
  Deliver fast, responsive interactions with clear error handling and smooth state transitions.
  
- **User-Centric Design:**  
  Create an intuitive, modern UI that makes content management and AI interaction seamless for both tech-savvy and non-technical users.
  
- **Robust AI Integration:**  
  Enable users to create, update, and interact with AI agents, incorporating templates and real-time data from Supabase.

- **Developer Experience:**  
  Use modern tech and clean architecture to ease future maintenance, scaling, and iterative development.

## 5. Technical Architecture and Proposed Tech Stack

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:**  
  React (with TypeScript)
  
- **Build Tool:**  
  Vite
  
- **Styling:**  
  Tailwind CSS, leveraging shadcn/ui component library for pre-built components
  
- **UI Components:**  
  Radix UI for accessible dialogs, dropdowns, and overlays  
  Lucide React for icons  

- **State Management:**  
  React Query (Tanstack Query) for API state management  
  Context API and custom hooks for local UI state

- **Routing:**  
  Client-side routing using react-router (if needed for multiple views)

- **Animation:**  
  Consider adding Framer Motion for declarative animations and smooth state transitions

### Backend & API Integration
- **Backend Service:**  
  Supabase for authentication, real-time data, and database queries

- **Data Transformation & Validation:**  
  Zod for schema validation  
  Custom hooks/services to abstract Supabase data handling

### Developer Experience & Tooling
- **Linting & Formatting:**  
  ESLint and Prettier configured for a consistent code style
- **Type Checking:**  
  TypeScript for strict typing and improved maintainability

### CI/CD & Deployment
- Leverage Vite’s fast build times and simple configuration for deployment  
- Consider automated deployments via Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred hosting provider (using Vite without Next)

## 6. Proposed Folder Structure (Simplified)

A cleaner project structure could look like:
```
/src
  /components    // Reusables shadcn UI components (buttons, dropdowns, forms, etc.)
  /hooks         // Custom hooks (useAgent, useTemplate, etc.)
  /pages         // Page-level components (Dashboard, Chat, Profile, Templates)
  /providers     // Context providers (Auth, Theme, Page, etc.)
  /lib           // API clients, utility functions, logging, etc.
  /styles        // Global Tailwind CSS or shared styles
  App.tsx        // Main App component
  main.tsx       // Entry point
/public
  assets         // Public images & resources
```
