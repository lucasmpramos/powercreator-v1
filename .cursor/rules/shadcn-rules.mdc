# Always refer to ShadCN docs when making layout or creating components

## Styling

1. Always use ShadCN styling. In a new component scenario, use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling. Avoid inline styles:
    
    ```tsx
    <div className="bg-white shadow-md rounded px-8 pt-6 pb-8 mb-4">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
    
    ```
2. Create custom Tailwind classes in the `tailwind.config.js` file for reusable styles.
3. Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles when needed.
